We start with trimming.

If we see [0-9] we reset the number flags.
We can only see . if we didn't see e or ..
We can only see e if we didn't see e but we did see a number. We reset numberAfterE flag.
We can only see + and - in the beginning and after an e
any other character break the validation.
At the and it is only valid if there was at least 1 number and if we did see an e then a number after it as well.

So basically the number should match this regular expression:

[-+]?(([0-9]+(.[0-9]*)?)|.[0-9]+)(e[-+]?[0-9]+)?
